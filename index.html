    <header><h1>The Beginning</h1></header>
    <p>In the beginning, there were atoms.<wbr>  
    Lonely single atoms.<br> Nobody knew from how or whence they came.<wbr>
    Nobody thought at all.<br> Thought didn't exist.There were only atoms, and
    pulses of energy. </p>
    <p>After many years, the atoms found each other and formed molecules.<br>
    Some found their own kind of molecules, and banded together to form<br> a <wbr>
    giant mass of homogenous molecules. Sometimes they allowed different<br> 
    molecules to join, and sometimes they mutually repulsed incompatible<wbr>
    molecules.
    <p>The molecules banded together more and more until the universe became<br>
    populated with giant globs of molecules, so powerful that they were able<br>
    to force small independent atoms and molecules to join them.  These globs<br>
    floated through space, occasionally crashing into each other with a mighty<br>
    crash  that sent molecules flying off in various directions, in search of<br>
    new molecules with which to mate.</p>

    <p>Eventually, some of the globs of matter collected the right combination of<br>
    molecules and energy to ignite, and give off massive amounts of light and heat.<br>
    Other non combusting globs were attracted to their mass, and circled around them<br>
    constantly basking in light and heat.  It came to pass that at the right distance,<br>
    the globs accumulated the right mixture of molecules to spawn living beings.</p>
    <p>The living things produced and consumed other living beings.  They developed<br>
    relationships and complex societies.  As the beings learned more and more about<br>
    their environment, they also had conflicts over space and resources.  They<br> 
    sometimes ate each other, and other living beings to sustain their energy needs.<br>
    There was a massive mixing of molecules.<p>

    <header><h1>The End</h1></header>
    <p>Entropy, the enemy of all order, once again ruled its ugly head.  Resources dwindledd<br>
    until the beings could no longer be sustained.  They dwindled, and finally ceased to exist<br>
    The giant blobs continued their endless circular devotion to the giant energy bearing masses,<br>
    and occasionally crashed into each other.</p>
    <p>The globs were eventally reduced to pebbles, then tiny grains, then once again single atoms.<br>
    The flaming balls of energy expended all their resources, and ceased to be.  A temperature of<br>
    absolute zero degrees Kelvin was reached uniformly, and there was darkness, silence and motionless<br>
    void.
